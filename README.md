# MPG - Memorable Password Generator

_*ESTE PROJETO FOI DEPRECIADO E NÃO É MAIS MANTIDO*_

This add-on is a password generator. It randomly chooses from a list of words from the chosen language to generate a password. The number of components indicates the number of words/numbers to be used. The separator is a select field to choose the special character that will be on the middle of components.

Clicking on the last generated password will copy it to your clipboard.

Help is always good. You can see the extension code on <https://github.com/ricardogouveia3/mpg-firefox-ext>
